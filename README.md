# Pig-game ðŸŽ®

The pig game is a two player board game.

## GAME RULES:

* The game has 2 players, each taking their turn
* On each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result is added to its `ROUND` score .
* BUT, if the player rolls the dice and rolls a 1, his `ROUND` score is lost. After that it's the next player's turn
* The player can choose 'Hold', which means their `ROUND` is added to the` GLOBAL` score . After that, it's the next player's turn.



## How to win:
* The first player to reach 100 points on `GLOBAL` wins the game.
